## 📊 Practical Datasets for Project Use

| Dataset | Why It's Useful | Link |
|---------|------------------|------|
| Netflix Movies & TV Shows | Great for categorical cleaning & EDA | [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows) |
| Video Game Sales | Contains price, platform, rating — perfect for IO framing | [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogame-sales-with-ratings) |
| Supermarket Sales | Daily transactions across branches | [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales) |
| Store Sales Forecasting | Contains date, store, item — useful for panel/data trends | [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/data) |

## 🧠 Economic Simulation & IO

4. **Industrial Organization: Markets and Strategies**
   - Authors: Belleflamme & Peitz
   - Use: Reference for demand functions, Cournot/Bertrand structure
   - Note: Conceptual overlap with lecture notes; helpful for mechanism modeling

5. **Python IO Blog Posts (Medium)**
   - Source: [Towards Data Science Economics](https://towardsdatascience.com/tagged/economics)
   - Use: Occasional inspiration for Bertrand sim, Hotelling, auctions
   - Caution: User-generated — verify logic

6. **MIT IO Course Notes (Optional)**
   - URL: https://ocw.mit.edu/
   - Use: Find problem sets, demand model examples, structural modeling outlines

## 📌 Summary: What to Focus on Next

| Task | Goal |
|------|------|
| 📁 Create GitHub project structure | Week1 folder: simulation + EDA project |
| 🧪 Simulate demand/cost data | Generate CSV with noise, plot D/C curves |
| 📊 Run EDA on Kaggle dataset | Netflix/Game sales → summary stats + plots |
| 📝 Document everything | Clear `README.md`, charts, and commit logs |
